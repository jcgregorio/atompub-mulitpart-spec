    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>
	The Atom Publishing Protocol <xref target="RFC5023" /> defines Media 
	Collections and how to create
	a Media Resource by POSTing the media to the Media Collection. RFC 5023 
	does not define handling multipart/related <xref target="RFC2387" /> 
	represenatations nor does it 
	specify how the acceptance of such representations should be 
	advertised in the Service Document. This specification covers both the 
	processing and the Service Document aspects of handling multipart/related content.
      </t>

      <section title="Notational Conventions">

	<t>
	  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
	  "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
	  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
	  interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
	</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Design Considerations">
	<t>
	  The primary objective of multipart/related POSTs is to 
	  reduce round-trips for creating Media Resources. 
	  There will be three round trips in the typical Media Resource
	  creation scenario; POST of the media, GET of the Media Link Entry, and subsequent
	  PUT of the updated Media Link Entry. This specification reduces that 
	  to just a single round-trip by allowing the client to package up
	  the media and the associated Media Link Entry into a single
	  multipart/related representation which is POSTed to the 
	  Media Collection.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The design of the handling of multipart/related representations
	  was aimed at backward compatibility, that is for non-multipart/related
	  aware clients to fully function. A second aim was to retain and 
	  utilize the expressiveness of the current app:accept element
	  in the Service Document. The last aim was to ease the burden on clients
	  by allowing the mulitpart representation to be constructed in an order
	  that was convenient for the client.
	</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Applicability">
	<t>
	  The applicability of multipart/related representations
	  to AtomPub Collections is restricted to just creating
	  new entries in Media collections. 
	  It does not specify the creation or use of a
	  resource that supports a GET to return the multipart/related representation
	  nor does it specify the creation or use of 
	  a resource that supports a PUT of a multipart/related 
	  representation.
	</t>

      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>
	The terms Collection, Media Resource, Media Link Entry, 
	and Service Document are used as defined in <xref target="RFC5023"/>.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Multipart Representations">
      <t>
	This section covers the constraints on a multipart/related 
	representation sent to a Media Collection. <xref target="servicedoc"/>
	covers how a client discovers that a Media Collection accepts
	multipart/related representations.
      </t>
      <t>
	A multipart/related POST to a Media Collection MUST be a valid
	multipart/related representation as defined by <xref target="RFC2387" />
	and MUST contain two body parts. One body part MUST be an Atom Entry
	with a media type of 'application/atom+xml' or 'application/atom+xml;type=entry'.
	The other body part MUST be of a media type acceptable to the
	collection. The order of the body parts and which one
	is the 'root' object are not relavant and an AtomPub service MUST accept
	otherwise valid multipart/related POST representations in either order. 
      </t>
      <t>
	That is, if a client is creating a media resource of type image/png
	it can either POST a multipart/related representation with a type
	parameter of either "application/atom+xml;type=entry" or "image/png".
	If the optional start parameter is provided it MAY point, via Content-ID,
	to either the image/png or the application/atom+xml object.
      </t>
      <t>
	A successful POST of a multipart/related representation to a Media 
	Collection proceeds as any successful Media Resource creation.
	The non-Atom object is used to create the Media Resource and the Atom
	Entry object is used to create the Media Link Entry. Media Resource
	creation proceeds as defined in Section 9.6 of <xref target="RFC5023"/> with a
	successful creation returning a 201 status code and a Location: header
	pointing to the newly created Media Link Entry. All other aspects of 
	<xref target="RFC5023"/> MUST be followed for Media Resource 
	creation including Slug: header	processing.
      </t>
      <t>
	While a multipart/related request replaces three round trips in the 
	typical Media Resource creation scenario, AtomPub has no mechanism to report
	partial success and the handling of a 
	multipart/related request by the server MUST be atomic; it should 
	either succeed with a 201 Created status code, or return an error
	status code. 
      </t>

    </section>

    <section title="Service Document Extension" anchor="servicedoc">
      <t>
	An AtomPub service announces that it will accept multipart/related POSTs
	by an extension to the app:accept element. The 'multipart' attribute
	is boolean valued, either "yes" or "no", and a "yes" indicates
	that the collection accepts multipart/related POSTs for the value
	of the app:accept element. The following example indicates a
	collection that allows the creation of resources with 
	the Ogg Bitstream Format and will also
	accept them in multipart form.

	<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
<app:accept multipart="yes">application/ogg</app:accept>
]]>
</artwork></figure>
      </t>

      <t>
	The 'multipart' attribute is foreign markup and will be ignored
	by clients that do not understand multipart/related uploads.
	In addition it permits the full range of the app:accept element 
	to be used. The following indicates that the collection accepts
	any image media type and will also accept them in multipart
	form.

	<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
<app:accept multipart="yes">image/*</app:accept>
]]></artwork></figure>
      </t>

      <t>
	The 'multipart' attribute can only have values of "yes" or "no".
	If not present the client MUST interpret the app:accept
	element as if the multipart attribute were present and
	had the value "no".
      </t>
     
      <t>
	The 'multipart' attribute allows clients that are unaware 
	of multipart/related to continue to operate as normal since
	the multipart attribute is foreign markup.
	The alternative, which was to put a multipart/related media type
	in the app:accept element loses flexibility since the 
	'type' parameter to the multipart/related media type accepts
	only media types and not media ranges.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section title="Examples">

      <t>
	Here is an example service document that 
	contains two media collections. The first collection
	accepts multipart/related POSTs for video media types only.
	The second collection accepts multipart/related POSTs
	for image/jpeg and image/png media types.
      </t>

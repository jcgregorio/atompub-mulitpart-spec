Internet-Draft  AtomPub Multipart Media Resource Creation    August 2008


1.  Introduction

   The Atom Publishing Protocol [RFC5023] defines Media Collections and
   how to create a Media Resource by POSTing the media to the Media
   Collection.  RFC 5023 does not define handling multipart/related
   [RFC2387] representations nor does it specify how the acceptance of
   such representations should be advertised in the Service Document.
   This specification covers both the processing and the Service
   Document aspects of handling multipart/related content.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Design Considerations

   The primary objective of multipart/related POSTs is to reduce round-
   trips for creating Media Resources.  There are three round trips in
   the typical Media Resource creation scenario; POST of the media, GET
   of the Media Link Entry, and subsequent PUT of the updated Media Link
   Entry.  This specification reduces that to just a single round-trip
   by allowing the client to package up the media and the associated
   Media Link Entry into a single multipart/related representation which
   is POSTed to the Media Collection.

   The design of the handling of multipart/related representations is
   aimed at backward compatibility, that is for non-multipart/related
   aware clients to fully function.  A second aim is to retain and
   utilize the expressiveness of the current app:accept element in the
   Service Document.  The last aim is to ease the burden on clients by
   allowing the multipart representation to be constructed in an order
   that is convenient for the client.

1.3.  Applicability

   The applicability of multipart/related representations to AtomPub
   Collections is restricted to the creation of new entries in Media
   collections.  It does not specify the creation or use of a resource
   that supports a GET to return the multipart/related representation
   nor does it specify the creation or use of a resource that supports a
   PUT of a multipart/related representation.


2.  Terminology

   The terms Collection, Media Resource, Media Link Entry, Foreign

Internet-Draft  AtomPub Multipart Media Resource Creation    August 2008


   Markup, and Service Document are used as defined in [RFC5023].  The
   term Object Root is used as defined in [RFC2387].


3.  Multipart Representations

   This section covers the constraints on a multipart/related
   representation sent to a Media Collection.  Section 5 covers how a
   client discovers that a Media Collection accepts multipart/related
   representations.

   There may be other specifications that define uses for multipart
   representations in the AtomPub context; this specification only
   describes one particular representation and how to use it in the
   media-resource creation process.  Follow-on multipart/related
   specifications will have to define a method by which a server can
   differentiate which specification is in force, which is beyond the
   scope of this document.

   A multipart/related POST to a Media Collection MUST be a valid
   multipart/related representation as defined by [RFC2387] and MUST
   contain two body parts.  One, referred to as the Media Part, MUST be
   an Atom Entry with a media type of 'application/atom+xml' or
   'application/atom+xml;type=entry'.  The other, referred to as the
   Media Part, MUST be of a media type acceptable to the collection.
   The object root MUST be the Entry Part.  The Entry Part's atom:
   content element MUST have a 'src' attribute whose value is the URI of
   the related media in the Media Part.  The 'src' attribute value MUST
   be a 'cid:' URI as defined by [RFC2392].  The Content-Type: header of
   the POST request MUST specify "application/atom+xml;type=entry" or
   "application/atom+xml".


4.  Server Processing

   A successful POST of a multipart/related representation to a Media
   Collection causes several resource-creation processes to occur as
   described in [RFC5023].  The Media Part is used to create a Media
   Resource as if it had been posted as a request body to the collection
   as described in section 9.6, and the Entry Part is used to create the
   corresponding Media Link Entry.  Assuming these two steps are
   successful, the server returns a 201 status code and a Location:
   header pointing to the newly created Media Link Entry.  The
   applicable rules from [RFC5023] MUST be followed, including Slug:
   header processing.

   While a multipart/related request replaces three round trips in the
   typical Media Resource creation scenario, AtomPub has no mechanism to

   report partial success.  Thus, the handling of a multipart/related
   request by the server MUST be atomic; that is, either succeed with a
   201 Created status code, or return an error status code.


5.  Service Document Extension

   An AtomPub service announces that it will accept multipart/related
   POSTs by an extension to the app:accept element.  The "alternate"
   attribute's value MUST be one more more tokens, space-separated if
   more than one.  The only token defined by this specification is
   "multipart-related".  The presence of the "multipart-related" token
   in the 'alternate' attribute's value indicates that the collection
   accepts multipart/related POSTs whose Media Part has a content-type
   matching that specified in the app:accept element.  The following
   example indicates a collection that allows the creation of resources
   with the Ogg Bitstream Format and will also accept them in multipart
   form.

  <app:accept alternate="multipart-related">application/ogg</app:accept>

   The 'multipart' attribute is foreign markup and will be ignored by
   clients that do not understand multipart/related uploads.  In
   addition it permits the full range of the app:accept element to be
   used.  The following indicates that the collection accepts any image
   media type and will also accept them in multipart form.

   <app:accept alternate="multipart-related">image/*</app:accept>

   The 'alternate' attribute allows clients that are unaware of
   multipart/related to continue to operate as normal since the
   alternate attribute is foreign markup.  The alternative, which is to
   put a multipart/related media type in the app:accept element, loses
   flexibility since the 'type' parameter to the multipart/related media
   type accepts only media types and not media ranges.


6.  Examples

   Here is an example service document that contains two media
   collections.  The first collection accepts multipart/related POSTs
   for video media types only.  The second collection accepts multipart/
   related POSTs for image/jpeg and image/png media types.

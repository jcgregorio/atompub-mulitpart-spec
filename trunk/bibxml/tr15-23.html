  <h2><a name="Introduction"></a>1 Introduction</h2>
  <p><i>The Unicode Standard</i> defines two equivalences between characters: 
  canonical equivalence and compatibility equivalence. Canonical equivalence is 
  a basic equivalency between characters or sequences of characters. The 
  following figure illustrates this equivalence:</p>
  <p align="center"><img border="0" src="Slide3.JPG" width="360" height="270" alt="Figure for canonical equivalence"></p>
  <p align="left">For round-trip compatibility with existing standards, Unicode 
  has encoded many entities that are really variants of existing nominal 
  characters. The visual representations of these character are typically a 
  subset of the possible visual representations of the nominal character. These 
  are given compatibility decompositions in the standard. Because the characters 
  are visually distinguished, replacing a character by a compatibility 
  equivalent may lose formatting information unless supplemented by markup or 
  styling. See the figure below for examples of compatibility equivalents:</p>
  <p align="center"><img border="0" src="Slide4.JPG" width="360" height="270" alt="Figure for compatibility equivalence"></p>
  <p align="left">Both canonical and compatibility equivalences are explained in 
  more detail in <i>The Unicode Standard, Chapters 2 and 3.</i> In addition, the 
  Unicode Standard describes several forms of normalization in Section 5.7 
  (Section 5.9 in <i>Version 2.0).</i> These normalization forms are designed to 
  produce a unique normalized form for any given string. Two of these forms are 
  precisely specified in Section 3.6. In particular, the standard defines a <i>canonical 
  decomposition</i> format, which can be used as a normalization for 
  interchanging text. This format allows for binary comparison while maintaining 
  canonical equivalence with the original unnormalized text.</p>
  <p>The standard also defines a <i>compatibility decomposition</i> format, 
  which allows for binary comparison while maintaining compatibility equivalence 
  with the original unnormalized text. The latter can also be useful in many 
  circumstances, since it levels the differences between characters which are 
  inappropriate in those circumstances. For example, the half-width and 
  full-width <i>katakana</i> characters will have the same compatibility 
  decomposition and are thus compatibility equivalents; however, they are not 
  canonical equivalents.</p>
  <p>Both of these formats are normalizations to decomposed characters. While 
  Section 3.6 also discusses normalization to composite characters (also known 
  as <i>decomposible</i> or <i>precomposed</i> characters), it does not 
  precisely specify a format. Because of the nature of the precomposed forms in 
  the Unicode Standard, there is more than one possible specification for a 
  normalized form with composite characters. This document provides a unique 
  specification for normalization, and a label for each normalized form.</p>
  <p>The four normalization forms are labeled as follows.</p>

  </table>
  <p>As with decomposition, there are two forms of normalization to composite 
  characters, <i>Normalization Form C</i> and <i>Normalization Form KC</i>. The 
  difference between these depends on whether the resulting text is to be a <i>canonical</i> 
  equivalent to the original unnormalized text, or is to be a <i>compatibility</i> 
  equivalent to the original unnormalized text. (In <i>NFKC</i> and <i>NFKD,</i> 
  a <i>K</i> is used to stand for <i>compatibility</i> to avoid confusion with 
  the <i>C</i> standing for <i>canonical</i>.) Both types of normalization can 
  be useful in different circumstances.</p>
  <p>The following diagram illustrates the effect of applying different 
  normalization forms to denormalized text. In the diagram, glyphs are colored 
  according to the characters they represent (this will not be visible in black 
  &amp; white printouts).</p>
  <p align="center"><img border="0" src="NormalizationOverview.GIF" alt="Figure for different normalizations" width="720" height="540"></p>
  <p>With <i>all</i> normalization forms, singleton characters (those with 
  singleton canonical mappings) are replaced. With NFD and NFC, compatibility 
  composites (characters with compatibility decompositions) are retained; with 
  NFKD and NFKC they are replaced. Notice that this sometimes loses significant 
  information, unless supplemented by markup or styling.</p>
  <p>With NFD and NFKD, composite characters are mapped to their canonical 
  decompositions. With NFC and NFKC, combining character sequences are mapped to 
  composites, if possible. Notice that there is no composite for e-ring, so it 
  is left decomposed in NFC and NFKC.</p>
  <p>All of the definitions in this document depend on the rules for equivalence 
  and decomposition found in Chapter 3 of <i>The Unicode Standard</i> and the 
  decomposition mappings in the Unicode Character Database.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Note: </b>Text containing only ASCII characters (U+0000 to U+007F) is 
    left unaffected by all of the normalization forms. This is particularly 
    important for programming languages (see <a href="#Programming_Language_Identifiers">Annex 
    7: Programming Language Identifiers</a>).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Normalization Form C uses canonical composite characters where possible, 
  and maintains the distinction between characters that are compatibility 
  equivalents. Typical strings of composite accented Unicode characters are 
  already in Normalization Form C. Implementations of Unicode which restrict 
  themselves to a repertoire containing no combining marks (such as those that 
  declare themselves to be implementations at Level 1 as defined in ISO/IEC 
  10646-1) are already typically using Normalization Form C. (Implementations of 
  later versions of 10646 need to be aware of the versioning issues â see <a href="#Versioning">Â§</a><a href="#Versioning">3 
  Versioning and Stability</a>.)</p>
  <p>The <i>W3C Character Model for the World Wide Web</i> [<a href="#CharMod">CharMod</a>] 
  uses Normalization Form C for XML and related standards (this document is not 
  yet final, but this requirement is not expected to change). See the <i>W3C 
  Requirements for String Identity, Matching, and String Indexing</i> [<a href="#CharReq">CharReq</a>] 
  for more background.</p>
  <p>Normalization Form KC additionally levels the differences between 
  compatibility-equivalent characters which are inappropriately distinguished in 
  many circumstances. For example, the half-width and full-width <i>katakana</i> 
  characters will normalize to the same strings, as will Roman Numerals and 
  their letter equivalents. More complete examples are provided in <a href="#Examples">Annex 
  1: Examples and Charts</a>.</p>
  <p>Normalization forms KC and KD must <i>not</i> be blindly applied to 
  arbitrary text. Since they erase many formatting distinctions, they will 
  prevent round-trip conversion to and from many legacy character sets, and 
  unless supplanted by formatting markup, may remove distinctions that are 
  important to the semantics of the text. The best way to think of these 
  normalization forms is like uppercase or lowercase mappings: useful in certain 
  contexts for identifying core meanings, but also performing modifications to 
  the text that may not always be appropriate. They can be applied more freely 
  to domains with restricted character sets, such as in <a href="#Programming_Language_Identifiers">Annex 
  7: Programming Language Identifiers</a>.</p>
  <p>To summarize the treatment of compatibility composites that were in the 
  source text:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Both NFD and NFC maintain compatibility composites.
    <li>Neither NFKD nor NFKC maintain compatibility composites.
    <li>None of the forms <i>generate</i> compatibility composites that were not 
      in the source text.
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Note: </b>Normalization Form KC does <i>not</i> attempt to map 
    character sequences to compatibility composites. For example, a 
    compatibility composition of &quot;office&quot; does <i>not</i> produce 
    &quot;o\uFB03ce&quot;, even though &quot;\uFB03&quot; is a character that is 
    the compatibility equivalent of the sequence of three characters 'ffi'.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="old_changed"><i>For a list of all characters that may change in any 
  of the normalization forms (aside from reordering), see <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/charts">Normalization

  <p><span class="old_changed">In using normalization functions, it is important

  </div>
  <p><span class="old_changed">However, it is possible to produce an optimized 
  function that concatenates two normalized strings, and <i>does</i> guarantee 
  that the result is normalized. Internally, it only needs to normalize 
  characters around the boundary of where the original strings were joined, 
  within stable code points. For more information, see <a href="#Stable_Code_Points">Stable 
  Code Points</a>.)</span></p>
  <p>However, all of the normalization forms <i>are</i> closed under 
  substringing. <span class="old_changed">For example, if one takes a substring 
  of a normalized string X, from offsets 5 to 10, one is guaranteed that the 
  resulting string is still normalized.</span></p>
  <h2><a name="Notation"></a>2 Notation</h2>
  <p>All of the definitions in this document depend on the rules for equivalence 
  and decomposition found in Chapter 3 of The Unicode Standard and the Character 
  Decomposition Mapping and Canonical Combining Class property in [<a href="#UCD">UCD</a>]. 
  Decomposition <i>must</i> be done in accordance with these rules. In 
  particular, the decomposition mappings found in the Unicode Character Database 
  must be applied recursively, and then the string put into canonical order 
  based on the characters' combining classes.</p>

  </ul>
  <h2><a name="Versioning"></a>3 Versioning and Stability</h2>
  <p>It is crucial that normalization forms remain stable over time. That is, if 
  a string (that does not have any unassigned characters) is normalized under 
  one version of Unicode, it must remain normalized under all future versions of 
  Unicode. This is the backwards compatibility requirement. To meet this 
  requirement, a&nbsp; fixed version for the composition process is specified, 
  called the <i>composition version.</i> The composition<i> </i>version is 
  defined to be <b>Version 3.1.0</b> of&nbsp; the Unicode Character Database. 
  For more information, see:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Versions of the Unicode Standard [<a href="#Versions">Versions</a>]
    <li>Unicode Character Database for Version 3.1 [<a href="#UCD">UCD</a>]
  </ul>
  <p>To see what difference the composition version makes, suppose that Unicode 
  4.0 adds the composite <i>Q-caron</i>. For an implementation that uses Unicode 
  4.0, strings in Normalization Forms C or KC will continue to contain the 
  sequence <i>Q&nbsp;+&nbsp;caron,</i> and <b>not</b> the new character <i>Q-caron</i>, 
  since a canonical composition for <i>Q-caron</i> was not defined in the 
  composition version. See <a href="#Primary_Exclusion_List_Table">Â§6 
  Composition Exclusion Table</a> for more information.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Note: </b>It would be possible to add more compositions in a future 
    version of Unicode, as long as the backward compatibility requirement is 
    met. That requires that for any new composition XY =&gt; Z, at most one of X 
    or Y was defined in a previous version of Unicode. That is, Z must be a new 
    character, and either X or Y must be a new character. However, the Unicode 
    Consortium strongly discourages new compositions, even in such restricted 
    cases.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In addition to fixing the composition version, future versions of Unicode 
  must be restricted in terms of the kinds of changes that can be made to 
  character properties. Because of this, the Unicode Consortium has a clear 
  policy to guarantee the stability of normalization forms: for more

  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Note: </b>The specifications for Normalization Forms are written in 
    terms of a process for producing a decomposition or composition from an 
    arbitrary Unicode string. This is a <i>logical</i> description â 
    particular implementations can have more efficient mechanisms as long as 
    they produce the same result. Similarly, testing for a particular 
    Normalization Form does not require applying the process of normalization, 
    so long as the result of the test is equivalent to applying normalization 
    and then testing for binary identity.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2><a name="Specification"></a>5 Specification</h2>
  <p>This section specifies the format for Normalization Forms C and KC. It uses 
  the following four definitions <a href="#D1">D1</a>, <a href="#D2">D2</a>, <a href="#D3">D3</a>, 
  <a href="#D4">D4</a>, and two rules <a href="#Normalization_Form_C">R1</a> and 
  <a href="#Normalization_Form_KC">R2</a>.</p>
  <p>All combining character sequences start with a character of combining class 
  zero. For simplicity, the following term is defined for such characters:</p>
  <p><a name="D1"></a><b>D1. </b>A character S is a <i>starter</i> if it has a 
  combining class of zero in the Unicode Character Database.</p>
  <p>Because of the definition of canonical equivalence, the order of combining 
  characters with the same combining class makes a difference. For example, <i>a-macron-breve</i> 
  is not the same as <i>a-breve-macron</i>. Characters can not be composed if 
  that would change the canonical order of the combining characters.</p>
  <p><a name="D2"></a><b>D2. </b>In any character sequence beginning with a 
  starter S, a character C is <i>blocked</i> from S if and only if there is some 
  character B between S and C, and either B is a starter or it has the same 
  combining class as C.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Note: </b>When B blocks C, changing the order of B and C would result 
    in a character sequence that is <i>not</i> canonically equivalent to the 
    original. See <i>Section 3.9 Canonical Ordering Behavior</i> in the Unicode 
    Standard.</p>
    <p><b>Note: </b>If a combining character sequence is in canonical order, 
    then testing whether a character is blocked only requires looking at the 
    immediately preceding character.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The process of forming a composition in Normalization Form C or KC 
  involves:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>decomposing the string according to the canonical (or compatibility, 
      respectively) mappings of the Unicode Character Database that corresponds 
      to the latest version of Unicode supported by the implementation, then
    <li>composing the resulting string according to the <i>canonical</i> 
      mappings of the composition version of the Unicode Character Database by 
      successively composing each unblocked character with the last starter.
  </ul>
  <p>Figure 1 shows a sample of how this works. The dark green cubes represent 
  starters, and the light gray cubes represent non-starters. In the first step, 
  the string is fully decomposed, and reordered. In the second step, each 
  character is checked against the last non-starter, and combined if all the 
  conditions are met. Examples are provided in <a href="#Examples">Annex 1: 
  Examples and Charts</a>, and a code sample is provided in <a href="#Code_Sample">Annex 
  5: Code Sample</a>.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="figure1.gif" alt="Basic composition process" width="429" height="141"></p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="4">Figure 1. Composition Process</font></b></p>
  <p>A precise notion is required for when an unblocked character can be 
  composed with a starter. This uses the following two definitions.</p>
  <p><a name="D3"></a><b>D3. </b>A <i>primary composite</i> is a character that 
  has a canonical decomposition mapping in the Unicode Character Database (or 
  has a canonical Hangul decomposition) but is not in the <a href="#Primary_Exclusion_List_Table">Â§6 
  Composition Exclusion Table</a>.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Note: </b>Hangul syllable decomposition is considered a canonical 
    decomposition. See <i><a href="http://www.unicode.org/uni2book/u2.html">The 
    Unicode Standard, Version 3.0</a></i>. Also see <a href="#Hangul">Annex 10: 
    Hangul</a>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><a name="D4"></a><b>D4. </b>A character X can be <i>primary combined</i> 
  with a character Y if and only if there is a primary composite Z which is 
  canonically equivalent to the sequence &lt;X, Y&gt;.</p>
  <p>Based upon these definitions, the following rules specify the Normalization 
  Forms C and KC.</p>
  <h3><a name="Normalization_Form_C"></a>R1. Normalization Form C</h3>
  <p>The Normalization Form C for a string S is obtained by applying the 
  following process, or any other process that leads to the same result:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Generate the <b><i>canonical</i></b> decomposition for the source string 
      S according to the decomposition mappings in the <i>latest supported</i> 
      version of the Unicode Character Database.
    <li>Iterate through each character C in that decomposition, from first to 
      last. If C is not blocked from the last starter L, and it can be primary 
      combined with L, then replace L by the composite L-C, and remove C.
  </ol>
  <p>The result of this process is a new string S' which is in Normalization 
  Form C.</p>
  <h3><a name="Normalization_Form_KC"></a>R2. Normalization Form KC</h3>
  <p>The Normalization Form KC for a string S is obtained by applying the 
  following process, or any other process that leads to the same result:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Generate the <b><i>compatibility</i></b> decomposition for the source 
      string S according to the decomposition mappings in the <i>latest 
      supported</i> version of the Unicode Character Database.
    <li>Iterate through each character C in that decomposition, from first to 
      last. If C is not blocked from the last starter L, and it can be primary 
      combined with L, then replace L by the composite L-C, and remove C.
  </ol>
  <p>The result of this process is a new string S' which is in Normalization 
  Form KC.</p>
  <h2><a name="Primary_Exclusion_List_Table"></a>6 Composition Exclusion Table</h2>
  <p>There are four classes of characters that are excluded from composition.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Script-specifics: </b>precomposed characters that are generally not 
      the preferred form for particular scripts.
      <ul>
        <li>These <i>cannot</i> be computed from information in the Unicode 
          Character Database.</li>
      </ul>
    <li><b>Post Composition Version: </b>precomposed characters that are added 
      after Unicode 3.0. This set will be updated with each subsequent version 
      of Unicode. For more information, see <a href="#Versioning">Â§</a><a href="#Versioning">3 
      Versioning and Stability</a>.
      <ul>
        <li>These <i>cannot</i> be computed from information in the Unicode 
          Character Database.</li>
      </ul>
    <li><b>Singletons: </b>characters having decompositions that consist of 
      single characters (as described below).
      <ul>
        <li>These <i>are</i> computed from information in the Unicode Character 
          Database.</li>
      </ul>
    <li><b>Non-starter decompositions: </b>precomposed characters whose 
      decompositions start with a non-starter.
      <ul>
        <li>These <i>are</i> computed from information in the Unicode Character 
          Database.</li>
      </ul>
  </ol>
  <p>Two characters may have the same canonical decomposition in the Unicode 
  Character Database. Here is an example of this:</p>
  <table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <th>Source</th>
      <th>Same Decomposition</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><tt>212B 'Ã' ANGSTROM SIGN</tt></td>
      <td rowspan="2">
        <p><tt>0041 'A'&nbsp;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER&nbsp;A</tt> + <tt>030A 'Â°'&nbsp;COMBINING 
        RING ABOVE</tt></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><tt>00C5 'Ã' LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE</tt></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>The Unicode Character Database will first decompose one of the characters 
  to the other, and then decompose from there. That is, one of the characters 
  (in this case <tt>ANGSTROM SIGN</tt>) will have a singleton decomposition. 
  Characters with singleton decompositions are included in Unicode essentially 
  for compatibility with certain pre-existing standards. These singleton 
  decompositions are excluded from primary composition.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><i>A machine-readable form data file is found in the 
    Composition Exclusion Table [<a href="#Exclusions">Exclusions</a>].</i></p>
    <p align="left"><i>All four classes of characters are included in this file, 
    although the singletons and non-starter decompositions are commented out.</i></p>
    <p align="left"><i>A derived property containing the complete list of 
    exclusions, <code>Comp_Ex</code>, is described in the UCD documentation [<a href="#UCDDoc">UCDDoc</a>].</i> 
    <i>Implementations can avoid computing the singleton and non-starter

  <h2><a name="Design_Goals"></a>Annex 2: Design Goals</h2>
  <p>The following are the design goals for the specification of the 
  normalization forms, and are presented here for reference.</p>
  <h3>Goal 1: Uniqueness</h3>
  <p>The first, and by far the most important, design goal for the normalization 
  forms is uniqueness: two equivalent strings will have <i>precisely</i> the 
  same normalized form. More explicitly,</p>
  <ol>
    <li>If two strings x and y are canonical equivalents, then
      <ul>
        <li>toNFC(x) = toNFC(y)
        <li>toNFD(x) = toNFD(y)
      </ul>
    <li>If two strings are compatibility equivalents, then
      <ul>
        <li>toNFKC(x) = toNFKC(y)
        <li>toNFKD(x) = toNFKD(y)
      </ul>
  </ol>
  <h3>Goal 2: Stability</h3>
  <p>The second major design goal for the normalization forms is stability of 
  characters that are not involved in the composition or decomposition process.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>If X contains a character with a compatibility decomposition, then 
      toNFD(X) and toNFC(X) still contain that character.<br>
      &nbsp;
    <li>As much as possible, if there are no combining characters in X, then 
      toNFC(X) = X.<br>
      &nbsp;
    <li>Irrelevant combining marks should not affect the results of composition. 
      See example <b>f</b> in <a href="#Examples">Annex 1: Examples and Charts</a>, 
      where the <i>horn</i> character does not affect the results of 
      composition.</li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Note: </b>The only characters for which Goal 2.2 is not true are those 
    in the <a href="#Primary_Exclusion_List_Table">Â§6 Composition Exclusion 
    Table</a>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>Goal 3: Efficiency</h3>
  <p>The third major design goal for the normalization forms is that it allow 
  for efficient implementations.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>It is possible to implement efficient code for producing the 
      Normalization Forms. In particular, it should be possible to produce 
      Normalization Form C very quickly from strings that are already in 
      Normalization Form C or are in Normalization Form D.<br>
      &nbsp;
    <li>Composition Forms do not have to produce the shortest possible results, 
      because that can be computationally expensive.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2><a name="Implementation_Notes"></a>Annex 3: Implementation Notes</h2>
  <p>There are a number of optimizations that can be made in programs that 
  produce Normalization Form C. Rather than first decomposing the text fully, a 
  quick check can be made on each character. If it is already in the proper 
  precomposed form, then no work has to be done. Only if the current character 
  is combining or in the <a href="#Primary_Exclusion_List_Table">Â§6 Composition 
  Exclusion Table</a> does a slower code path need to be invoked. (This code 
  path will need to look at previous characters, back to the last starter. See <a href="#Annex8">Annex 
  8: Detecting Normalization Forms</a> for more information.)</p>
  <p>The majority of the cycles spent in doing composition is spent looking up 
  the appropriate data. The data lookup for Normalization Form C can be very 
  efficiently implemented, since it only has to look up pairs of characters, not 
  arbitrary strings. First a multi-stage table (aka <i>trie;</i> see Chapter 5 
  of the Unicode Standard) is used to map a character <i>c</i> to a small 
  integer <i>i</i> in a contiguous range from 0 to <i>n.</i> The code for doing 
  this looks like:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>i = data[index[c &gt;&gt; BLOCKSHIFT] + (c &amp; BLOCKMASK)];</pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Then a pair of these small integers are simply mapped through a 
  two-dimensional array to get a resulting value. This yields much better 
  performance than a general-purpose string lookup in a hash table.</p>
  <p>Since the Hangul compositions and decompositions are algorithmic, memory 
  storage can be significantly reduced if the corresponding operations are done 
  in code. See <a href="#Hangul">Annex 10: Hangul</a> for more information.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Note: </b>Any such optimizations must be carefully checked to ensure 
    that they still produce conformant results. In particular, the code must 
    still be able to pass the test described in <i><a href="#Conformance_Testing">Annex 
    9: Conformance Testing</a>.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="old_changed">For more information on useful implementation 
  techniques, see <a href="#Detecting_Normalization_Forms">Annex 8: Detecting 
  Normalization Forms</a>, and <a href="http://www.unicode.org/notes/tn5">UTN #5 
  Canonical Equivalences in Applications</a>.</p>
  <h2><a name="Decomposition"></a>Annex 4: Decomposition</h2>
  <p>For those reading this document without access to the Unicode Standard, the 
  following summarizes the canonical decomposition process. For a complete 
  discussion, see <i>Sections 3.6 and 3.10 </i>of the Unicode Standard.</p>
  <p><i>Canonical decomposition</i> is the process of taking a string, 
  recursively replacing composite characters using the Unicode canonical 
  decomposition mappings (including the algorithmic Hangul canonical 
  decomposition mappings, see <a href="#Hangul">Annex 10: Hangul</a>), and 
  putting the result in canonical order.</p>
  <p><i>Compatibility decomposition</i> is the process of taking a string, 
  replacing composite characters using <i>both</i> the Unicode canonical 
  decomposition mappings <i>and</i> the Unicode compatibility decomposition 
  mappings, and putting the result in canonical order.</p>
  <p>A string is put into <i>canonical order</i> by repeatedly replacing any 
  exchangeable pair by the pair in reversed order. When there are no remaining 
  exchangeable pairs, then the string is in canonical order. Note that the 
  replacements can be done in any order.</p>
  <p>A sequence of two adjacent characters in a string is an <i>exchangeable 
  pair</i> if the combining class (from the Unicode Character Database) for the 
  first character is greater than the combining class for the second, and the 
  second is not a starter; that is, if <code>combiningClass(first) &gt; 
  combiningClass(second) &gt; 0</code>.</p>
  <p><i>Examples of exchangeable pairs:</i></p>

  <p><i>Example of decomposition:</i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li>Take the string with the characters &quot;Ã¡cÂ´Â¸&quot; <i>(a-acute, 
        c, acute, cedilla)</i></li>
      <li>The data file contains the following relevant information:<br>
        <i>code; name; ... combining class; ... decomposition.</i>
        <pre>0061;LATIN SMALL LETTER A;...0;...

      <li>Applying the canonical decomposition mappings, we get &quot;aÂ´cÂ´Â¸&quot; 
        <i>(a, acute, c, acute, cedilla).</i>
        <ul>
          <li>This is because <tt>00E1</tt> <i>(a-acute)</i> has a canonical

          <li>This is because <i>cedilla</i> has a lower combining class (202) 
            than acute (230) does. The positions of 'a' and 'c' are not 
            affected, since they are starters.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote>
  <h2><a name="Code_Sample"></a>Annex 5: Code Sample</h2>
  <p>A code sample is available for the four different normalization forms. For 
  clarity, this sample is not optimized. The implementations for NFKC and NFC 
  transform a string in two passes: pass 1 decomposes, while pass 2 composes by 
  successively composing each unblocked character with the last starter.</p>
  <p>In some implementations, people may be working with streaming interfaces 
  that read and write small amounts at a time. In those implementations, the 
  text back to the last starter needs to be buffered. Whenever a second starter 
  would be added to that buffer, the buffer can be flushed.</p>
  <p>The sample is written in Java, though for accessibility it avoids the use 
  of object-oriented techniques. For access to the code, and for a live 
  demonstration, see <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/Normalizer.html">Normalizer.html</a> 
  [<a href="#Sample">Sample</a>]. Equivalent Perl code is available on the W3C 
  site [<a href="#CharLint">CharLint</a>].</p>
  <h2><a name="Legacy_Encodings"></a>Annex 6: Legacy Encodings</h2>
  <p>While the Normalization Forms are specified for Unicode text, they can also 
  be extended to non-Unicode (legacy) character encodings. This is based on 
  mapping the legacy character set strings to and from Unicode using definitions 
  <a href="#D5">D5</a> and <a href="#D6">D6</a>.</p>
  <p><a name="D5"></a><b>D5. </b>An <i>invertible transcoding</i> T for a legacy 
  character set L is a one-to-one mapping from characters encoded in L to 
  characters in Unicode with an associated mapping T<sup>-1</sup> such that for 
  any string S in L, T<sup>-1</sup>(T(S))&nbsp;=&nbsp;S.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Note: </b>Typically there is a single accepted invertible transcoding 
    for a given legacy character set. In in a few cases there may be multiple 
    invertible transcodings: for example, Shift-JIS may have two different 
    mappings used in different circumstances: one to preserve the '/' semantics 
    of 2F<sub>16</sub>, and one to preserve the 'Â¥' semantics.</p>
    <p><b>Note: </b>The character indexes in the legacy character set string may 
    be very different than character indexes in the Unicode equivalent. For 
    example, if a legacy string uses visual encoding for Hebrew, then its first 
    character might be the last character in the Unicode string.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If you implement transcoders for legacy character sets, it is recommended 
  that you ensure that the result is in Normalization Form C where possible. See 
  <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr22/">UTR #22: Character Mapping 
  Tables</a> for more information.</p>
  <p><a name="D6"></a><b>D6. </b>Given a string S encoded in L and an invertible 
  transcoding T for L, the <i>Normalization Form X of S under T</i> is defined 
  to be the result of mapping to Unicode, normalizing to Unicode Normalization 
  Form X, and mapping back to the legacy character encoding, e.g.,&nbsp;T<sup>-1</sup>(NFX(T(S))). 
  Where there is a single accepted invertible transcoding for that character 
  set, we can simply speak of the Normalization Form X of S.</p>
  <p>Legacy character sets fall into three categories based on their 
  normalization behavior with accepted transcoders.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><i>Prenormalized. </i>Any string in the character set is already in 
      Normalization Form X.
      <ul>
        <li>For example, ISO 8859-1 is prenormalized in NFC.</li>
      </ul>
    <li><i>Normalizable.</i> Although the set is not prenormalized, any string 
      in the set <i>can</i> be normalized to Form X.
      <ul>
        <li>For example, ISO 2022 (with a mixture of ISO 5426 and ISO 8859-1) is 
          normalizable.</li>
      </ul>
    <li><i>Unnormalizable.</i> Some strings in the character set cannot be 
      normalized into Form X.
      <ul>
        <li>For example, ISO 5426 is unnormalizable in NFC under common 
          transcoders, since it contains combining marks but not composites.</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>
  <h2><a name="Programming_Language_Identifiers"></a>Annex 7: Programming 
  Language Identifiers</h2>
  <p>This section discusses issues that must be taken into account when 
  considering normalization of identifiers in programming languages or scripting 
  languages. The Unicode Standard provides a recommended syntax for identifiers 
  for programming languages that allow the use of non-ASCII languages in code. 
  It is a natural extension of the identifier syntax used in C and other 
  programming languages:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>&lt;identifier&gt; ::= &lt;identifier_start&gt; ( &lt;identifier_start&gt; | &lt;identifier_extend&gt; )*

&lt;identifier_start&gt; ::= [{Lu}{Ll}{Lt}{Lm}{Lo}{Nl}]

&lt;identifier_extend&gt; ::= [{Mn}{Mc}{Nd}{Pc}{Cf}]</pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>That is, the first character of an identifier can be an <i>uppercase 
  letter, lowercase letter, titlecase letter, modifier letter, other letter, </i>or<i> 
  letter number.</i> The subsequent characters of an identifier can be any of 
  those, plus <i>non-spacing marks, spacing combining marks, decimal numbers, 
  connector punctuations, </i>and<i> formatting codes (such as right-left-mark).</i> 
  Normally the formatting codes should be filtered out before storing or 
  comparing identifiers.</p>
  <p><font color="#000000">Normalization as described in this report can be used 
  to avoid problems</font> <font color="#000000">where apparently identical 
  identifiers are not treated equivalently. Such problems can appear both during 
  compilation and during linking, in particular also across different 
  programming languages.</font> To avoid such problems, programming languages 
  can normalize identifiers before storing or comparing them. Generally if the 
  programming language has case-sensitive identifiers then Normalization Form C 
  may be used, while if the programming language has case-insensitive 
  identifiers then Normalization Form KC may be more appropriate.</p>
  <p>If programming languages are using NFKC to level (&quot;fold&quot;) 
  differences between characters, then they need to use a slight modification of 
  the identifier syntax from the Unicode Standard to deal with the 
  idiosyncrasies of a small number of characters. These characters fall into 
  three classes:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Middle Dot. </b>Because most Catalan legacy data will be encoded in 
      Latin-1, <code>U+00B7 MIDDLE DOT</code> needs to be allowed in <code>&lt;identifier_extend&gt;</code>. 
      (If the programming language is using a dot as an operator, then <code>U+2219 
      BULLET OPERATOR</code> or <code>U+22C5 DOT OPERATOR</code> should be used 
      instead. However, care should be taken when dealing with <code>U+00B7 
      MIDDLE DOT</code>, as many processes will assume its use as punctuation, 
      rather than as a letter extender.)</li>
    <li><b>Combining-like characters. </b>Certain characters are not formally 
      combining characters, although they behave in most respects as if they 
      were. Ideally, they should not be in <code>&lt;identifier_start&gt;</code>, 
      but rather in <code>&lt;identifier_extend&gt;</code>, along with combining 
      characters. In most cases, the mismatch does not cause a problem, but when 
      these characters have compatibility decompositions, they can cause 
      identifiers not to be closed under Normalization Form KC. In particular, 
      the following four characters should be in <code>&lt;identifier_extend&gt;</code> 
      and not <code>&lt;identifier_start&gt;</code>:
      <ul>
        <li><code>0E33 THAI CHARACTER SARA AM</code></li>
        <li><code>0EB3 LAO VOWEL SIGN AM</code></li>
        <li><code>FF9E HALFWIDTH KATAKANA VOICED SOUND MARK</code></li>
        <li><code>FF9F HALFWIDTH KATAKANA SEMI-VOICED SOUND MARK</code></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Irregularly decomposing characters. </b><code>U+037A GREEK 
      YPOGEGRAMMENI</code> and certain Arabic presentation forms have irregular 
      compatibility decompositions, and need to be excluded from both <code>&lt;identifier_start&gt;</code> 
      and <code>&lt;identifier_extend&gt;</code>. It is recommended that all 
      Arabic presentation forms be excluded from identifiers in any event, 
      although only a few of them are required to be excluded for normalization 
      to guarantee identifier closure.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>With these amendments to the identifier syntax, all identifiers are closed 
  under all four Normalization forms. This means that for any string S,</p>
  <p align="center"><code>isIdentifier(S) implies</code></p>
  <p align="center"><code>isIdentifier(toNFD(S))<br>
  isIdentifier(toNFC(S))<br>
  isIdentifier(toNFKD(S))<br>
  isIdentifier(toNFKC(S))</code></p>
  <p>Identifiers are also closed under case operations (with one exception), so 
  that for any string S,</p>
  <p align="center"><code>&nbsp;isIdentifier(S) implies</code></p>
  <p align="center"><code>isIdentifier(toLowercase(S))<br>
  </code><code>isIdentifier(toUppercase(S))<br>
  isIdentifier(toFoldedcase(S))</code></p>
  <p>The one exception is <code>U+0345 COMBINING GREEK YPOGEGRAMMENI</code>. In 
  the very unusual case that <code>U+0345</code> is at the start of S,&nbsp; <code>U+0345</code> 
  is not in <code>&lt;identifier_start&gt;</code>, but its uppercase and 
  case-folder version are. In practice this is not a problem, because of the way 
  normalization is used with identifiers.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Note: </b>Those programming languages with case-insensitive 
    identifiers should use the case foldings described in <i>Section 3.13 
    Default Case Operations</i> to produce a case-insensitive normalized form.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>When source text (such as program source) is parsed for identifiers, the 
  identifiers must be parsed before folding distinctions using case mapping or 
  NFKC.</p>
  <p>When source text (such as program source) is parsed for identifiers, the 
  folding of distinctions (using case mapping or NFKC) must be delayed until 
  after parsing has located the identifiers. Thus such folding of distinctions 
  should not be applied to string literals or to comments in program source 
  text.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Note: </b>The Unicode Character Database [<a href="#UCD">UCD</a>] 
    provides derived properties that can be used by implementations for parsing 
    identifiers, both normalized and unnormalized. These are the properties <code>ID_Start</code>, 
    <code>ID_Continue</code>, <code>XID_Start</code>, and <code>XID_Continue</code>. 
    Unicode 3.1 also provides support for handling case folding with 
    normalization: the <span class="old_changed">Unicode Character Database 
    property FC_NFKC_Closure</span> can be used in case folding, so that a case 
    folding of an NFKC string is itself normalized. These properties, and the 
    files containing them, are described in the UCD documentation [<a href="#UCDDoc">UCDDoc</a>].</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Code that uses this property can do a <i>very</i> fast first pass over a 
  string to determine the normalization form. The result is also either NO, YES, 
  or MAYBE. For NO or YES, the answer is definite. In the MAYBE case, a more 
  thorough check must be made, typically by putting a copy of the string into 
  the normalization form, and checking for equality with the original.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p class="old_changed">Even the slow case can be optimized, with a 
      function that does not perform a complete normalization of the entire 
      string, but instead works incrementally, only normalizing a limited area 
      around the MAYBE character. See <a href="#Stable_Code_Points">Stable Code 
      Points</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This check is much faster than simply running the normalization algorithm, 
  since it avoids any memory allocation and copying. The vast majority of 
  strings will return a definitive YES or NO answer, leaving only a small 
  percentage that require more work. The sample below is written in Java, though 
  for accessibility it avoids the use of object-oriented techniques.</p>
  <pre>public int quickCheck(String source) {
    short lastCanonicalClass = 0;
    int result = YES;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; source.length(); ++i) {
        char ch = source.charAt(i);

  <p>The <code>isAllowed()</code> call should access the data from Derived 
  Normalization Properties file [<a href="#NormProps">NormProps</a>] for the 
  normalization form in question.&nbsp; (For more information, see the UCD 
  documentation [<a href="#UCDDoc">UCDDoc</a>].) For example, here is a segment 
  of the data for NFC:</p>
  <pre>...
0338       ; NFC_MAYBE # Mn     COMBINING LONG SOLIDUS OVERLAY
...
F900..FA0D ; NFC_NO    # Lo [270] CJK COMPATIBILITY IDEOGRAPH-F900..CJK COMPATIBILITY IDEOGRAPH-FA0D
...</pre>
  <p>These lines assign the value NFC_MAYBE to the code point U+0338, and the 
  value NFC_NO to the codepoints in the range U+F900 .. U+FA0D. Note that there 
  are no MAYBE values for NFD and NFKD: the <code>quickCheck</code> function 
  will always produce a precise result for these normalization forms. All 
  characters that are not specifically mentioned in the file have the values 
  YES.</p>
  <p>The data for the implementation of the <code>isAllowed()</code> call can be 
  accessed in memory with a hashtable or a trie (see <a href="#Implementation_Notes">Annex 
  3: Implementation Notes</a>); the latter will be the fastest.</p>
  <h3 class="old_changed"><a name="Stable_Code_Points">Stable Code Points</a></h3>
  <p class="old_changed">It may also be useful to distinguish the set of code 
  points that are <i>stable</i> under a particular normalization form. They are 
  the set of code points never affected by that particular normalization 
  process. This property is very useful for skipping over text that does not 
  need to be considered at all, either when normalizing or when testing 
  normalization. Formally, each stable code point CP fulfills all the following 
  conditions:</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      <p class="old_changed">CP has canonical combining class 0, and
    <li>
      <p class="old_changed">CP is (as a single character) not changed by this

  <p class="old_changed"><i>Example: </i>In NFC, <i>a-breve</i> satisfies all

  satisfy (a-e).</p>
  <h2><a name="Conformance_Testing"></a>Annex 9: Conformance Testing (Normative)</h2>
  <p>Implementations must be thoroughly tested for conformance to the 
  normalization specification. In <a href="http://www.unicode.org/standard/versions/enumeratedversions.html">Unicode 
  3.0.1</a>, the Normalization Conformance Test [<a href="#Test">Test</a>] file 
  was added for use in testing conformance. This file consists of a series of

  <h2><a name="Hangul"></a>Annex 10: Hangul</h2>
  <p>Since the Hangul compositions and decompositions are algorithmic, memory 
  storage can be significantly reduced if the corresponding operations are done 
  in code rather than by simply storing the data in the general purpose tables. 
  Here is sample code illustrating algorithmic Hangul canonical decomposition 
  and composition done according to the specification in <i>Section 3.11 
  Combining Jamo Behavior.</i> Although coded in Java, the same structure can be 
  used in other programming languages.</p>
  <h4>Common Constants</h4>
  <pre>    static final int
        SBase = 0xAC00, LBase = 0x1100, VBase = 0x1161, TBase = 0x11A7,
        LCount = 19, VCount = 21, TCount = 28,
        NCount = VCount * TCount,   // 588
        SCount = LCount * NCount;   // 11172</pre>
  <h4>Hangul Decomposition</h4>
  <pre>    public static String decomposeHangul(char s) {
        int SIndex = s - SBase;
        if (SIndex &lt; 0 || SIndex &gt;= SCount) {

        int L = LBase + SIndex / NCount;
        int V = VBase + (SIndex % NCount) / TCount;
        int T = TBase + SIndex % TCount;
        result.append((char)L);
        result.append((char)V);
        if (T != TBase) result.append((char)T);
        return result.toString();
    }</pre>
  <h4>Hangul Composition</h4>
  <p>Notice an important feature of Hangul composition: whenever the source 
  string is not in Normalization Form D, you can not just detect character 
  sequences of the form &lt;L,&nbsp;V&gt; and &lt;L,&nbsp;V,&nbsp;T&gt;. You 
  also must catch the sequences of the form &lt;LV,&nbsp;T&gt;. To guarantee 
  uniqueness, these sequences must also be composed. This is illustrated in Step 
  2 below.</p>
  <pre>    public static String composeHangul(String source) {
        int len = source.length();
        if (len == 0) return &quot;&quot;;
        StringBuffer result = new StringBuffer();
        char last = source.charAt(0);            <span class="comment">// copy first char</span>
        result.append(last);

        for (int i = 1; i &lt; len; ++i) {
            char ch = source.charAt(i);

            <span class="comment">// 1. check to see if two current characters are L and V</span>

            int LIndex = last - LBase;
            if (0 &lt;= LIndex &amp;&amp; LIndex &lt; LCount) {
                int VIndex = ch - VBase;
                if (0 &lt;= VIndex &amp;&amp; VIndex &lt; VCount) {

                    <span class="comment">// make syllable of form LV</span>

                    last = (char)(SBase + (LIndex * VCount + VIndex) * TCount);
<span class="comment">                    </span>result.setCharAt(result.length()-1, last); <span class="comment">// reset last</span>
                    continue; <span class="comment">// discard ch</span>
                }
            }

            <span class="comment">// 2. check to see if two current characters are LV and T</span>

            int SIndex = last - SBase;
            if (0 &lt;= SIndex &amp;&amp; SIndex &lt; SCount &amp;&amp; (SIndex % TCount) == 0) {
                int TIndex = ch - TBase;
                if (0 &lt;= TIndex &amp;&amp; TIndex &lt;= TCount) {

                    <span class="comment">// make syllable of form LVT</span>

                    last += TIndex;
                    result.setCharAt(result.length()-1, last); <span class="comment">// reset last</span>
                    continue; <span class="comment">// discard ch</span>
                }
            }

            <span class="comment">// if neither case was true, just add the character</span>

            last = ch;
            result.append(ch);
        }
        return result.toString();
    }</pre>
  <p>Additional transformations can be performed on sequences of Hangul jamo for 
  various purposes. For example, to regularize sequences of Hangul jamo into 
  standard syllables, the <i>choseong</i> and <i>jungseong</i> fillers can be 
  inserted, as described in Chapter 3. (In the text of the 2.0 version of the 
  Unicode Standard, these standard syllables were called <i>canonical syllables</i>, 
  but this has nothing to do with canonical composition or decomposition.) For 
  keyboard input, additional compositions may be performed. For example, the 
  trailing consonants k<font size="-1"><sub>f</sub></font> + s<font size="-1"><sub>f</sub></font> 
  may be combined into ks<font size="-1"><sub>f</sub></font>. In addition, some 
  Hangul input methods do not require a distinction on input between initial and 
  final consonants, and change between them on the basis of context. For 
  example, in the keyboard sequence m<sub>i</sub> + e<sub>m</sub> + n<sub>i</sub> 
  + s<sub>i</sub> + a<sub>m</sub>, the consonant n<sub>i</sub> would be 
  reinterpreted as n<sub>f</sub>, since there is no possible syllable <i>nsa</i>. 
  This results in the two syllables <i>men</i> and <i>sa.</i></p>
  <p>However, none of these additional transformations are considered part of 
  the Unicode Normalization Formats.</p>
  <h4>Hangul Character Names</h4>
  <p>Hangul decomposition is also used to form the character names for the 
  Hangul syllables. While the sample code that illustrates this process is not 
  directly related to normalization, it is worth including because it is so 
  similar to the decomposition code.</p>

  <h2><a name="Corrigenda">Annex 12: Corrigenda</a></h2>
  <p class="old_changed">The Unicode Consortium has well-defined policies in 
  place to govern changes that affect backwards compatibility. For information 
  on these stability policies, especially regarding normalization, see <a href="http://www.unicode.org/policies">Unicode 
  Policies</a> [<a href="#Policies">Policies</a>]. In particular:
  <blockquote>
    <p class="old_changed"><i>Once a character is encoded, its canonical 
    combining class and decomposition mapping will not be changed in a way that 
    will destabilize normalization.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="old_changed">What this means is:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="old_changed"><i>If a string contains only characters from a given 
    version of the Unicode Standard (e.g., Unicode 3.1.1), and it is put into a 
    normalized form in accordance with that version of Unicode, then it will be 
    in normalized form according to any past or future versions of Unicode.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="old_changed">This guarantee has been in place for Unicode 3.1 and 
  after. It has been necessary to correct the decompositions of a small number 
  of characters since Unicode 3.1, as listed in the Normalization Corrections 
  data file [<a href="#Corrections">Corrections</a>], but such corrections are 
  in accordance with the above principles: all text normalized on old systems 
  will test as normalized in future systems. All text normalized in future 
  systems will test as normalized on past systems. What may change, for those 
  few characters, is that <i>unnormalized</i> text may normalize differently on 
  past and future systems.</p>
  <p class="old_changed">It is straightforward for any implementation with a 
  future version of Unicode to support all past versions of normalization. For 
  an implementation of Unicode Version X to support a version of NFC that 
  precisely matches a older Unicode Version Y, the following two steps are 
  taken:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p class="old_changed">Before applying the normalization algorithm, map

          <p class="old_changed">Use the table in [<a href="#Corrections">Corrections</a>] 
          for this step, by including any code points that have a version later 
          than Y and less than or equal to X.</li>
        <li>
          <p class="old_changed">For example, for a Unicode 4.0 implementation

    <li>

        <li>
          <p class="old_changed">That is, the code points will not decompose or

  <h2 class="old_changed">Annex 13: <a name="Canonical_Equivalence">Canonical 
  Equivalence</a></h2>
  <p class="old_changed">This section describes the relationship of 
  normalization to respecting (or preserving) canonical equivalence. A process 
  (or function) <i>respects</i> canonical equivalence when canonical equivalent 
  inputs always produce canonically equivalent outputs. For functions that map 
  strings to strings, this is often called <i>preserving</i> canonical 
  equivalence. There are a number of important aspects to this concept:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p class="old_changed">The outputs are <i>not</i> required to be 
      identical, only canonically equivalent.
    <li>
      <p class="old_changed"><i>Not</i> all processes are required to respect 
      canonical equivalence. For example:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="old_changed">A function that collects a set of the 
          General_Category values present in a string will and should produce a 
          different value for &lt;<font face="Arial Unicode MS"><i>angstrom 
          sign, semicolon&gt;</i></font> above than for &lt;<i><font face="Arial Unicode MS">A, 
          combining ring above, greek question mark&gt;</font></i>, even though 
          they are canonically equivalent.
        <li>
          <p class="old_changed">A function that does a binary comparison of 
          strings will also find these two sequences different.</li>
      </ul>
    <li>
      <p class="old_changed">However, higher level processes that transform or 
      compare strings, or perform other higher level functions, must respect 
      canonical equivalence or problems will result.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="old_changed">The canonically equivalent inputs or outputs are not 
  just limited to strings, but are also relevant to the <i>offsets</i> within 
  strings, since those play a fundamental role in Unicode string processing.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="old_changed">Offset P into string X is canonically equivalent to 
    offset Q into string Y if and only if both of the following conditions are 
    true:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p class="old_changed">X[0, P] â Y[0, Q], and</li>
      <li>
        <p class="old_changed">X[P, len(X)] â Y[0, len(Y)]</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="old_changed">This can be written as P in X â Q in Y. Note that 
  whenever X and Y are canonically equivalent, it follows that 0 in X â 0 in 
  Y, and len(X) in X â len(Y) in Y.</p>
  <p class="old_changed"><i>Example:</i></p>
  <ol>

  <p class="old_changed">The following are examples of processes that involve 
  canonically equivalent strings <i>and/or</i> offsets.</p>
  <p class="old_changed"><i>Examples:</i></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p class="old_changed">When <code>isWordBreak(string, offset)</code> 
      respects canonical equivalence,&nbsp; then
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="old_changed"><code>isWordBreak(</code>&lt;<i>A-ring, 
          semicolon</i>&gt;, 1<code>)</code> = <code>isWordBreak(</code>&lt;<i>A,

      </ul>
    <li>
      <p class="old_changed">When <code>nextWordBreak(string, offset)</code>

        <li>
          <p class="old_changed"><code>nextWordBreak(</code>&lt;<i>A-ring,

          ring, semicolon</i>&gt;, 0<code>)</code> = 2.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p class="old_changed">Respecting canonical equivalence is related to, but 
  different from, preserving a canonical normalization form NFx (where NFx means 
  either NFD or NFC). In a process that preserves a normalization form, whenever 
  any input string is normalized according to that normalization form, then 
  every output string is also normalized according to that form. If a process 
  preserves a canonical normalization form, then it respects canonical 
  equivalence, but not necessarily vice versa.</p>
  <p class="old_changed">In building a system that as a whole respects canonical 
  equivalence, there are two basic strategies, with some variations on the 
  second strategy. These strategies are:

      <p class="old_changed">Ensure that each system component respects 
      canonical equivalence,
    <li>
      <p class="old_changed">Ensure that each system component preserves NFx, 
      and one of the following:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p class="old_changed">Reject any non-NFx text on input to the whole 
          system
        <li>
          <p class="old_changed">Reject any non-NFx text on input to each 
          component
        <li>
          <p class="old_changed">Normalize to NFx all text on input to the whole 
          system
        <li>
          <p class="old_changed">Normalize to NFx all text on input to each 
          component
        <li>
          <p class="old_changed">All three of the following:
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              <p class="old_changed">Allow text to be marked as NFx when 
              generated.
            <li>
              <p class="old_changed">Normalize any unmarked text on input to 
              each component to NFx
            <li>
              <p class="old_changed">Reject any marked text that is not NFx</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p class="old_changed">There are trade-offs for each of these strategies. The 
  best choice or mixture of strategies will depend on the structure of the 
  components and their interrelations, and how fine-grained or low-level those 
  components are. One key piece of information is that it is much faster to 
  check that text is NFx than it is to convert it. This is especially true in 
  the case of NFC. So even where it says &quot;normalize&quot; above, a good 
  technique is to first check if normalization is required, and only perform the 
  extra processing if necessary.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p class="old_changed">Strategy A is the most robust, but may be less 
      efficient.
    <li>
      <p class="old_changed">Strategy B1 &amp; B2 are the most efficient, but 
      would reject some data, including that converted 1:1 from some legacy code 
      pages.
    <li>
      <p class="old_changed">Strategy B3 doesn't have the problem of rejecting 
      data. It can be more efficient than A: since each component is assured 
      that all of its input is in a particular normalization form, it does not 
      need to normalize, except internally. But it is less robust: any component 
      that fails can &quot;leak&quot; unnormalized text into the rest of the 
      system.
    <li>
      <p class="old_changed">Strategy B4 is more robust than B1, but less 
      efficient, since there are multiple points where text needs to be checked.
    <li>
      <p class="old_changed">Strategy B5 can be a reasonable compromise; it is 
      robust, but allows for all text input.</li>
